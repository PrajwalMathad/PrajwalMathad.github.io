The project was about 3D reconstruction of objects using images captured from a drone.  The project mainly focused on building an end-to-end pipeline for 3D reconstruction. The pipeline was developed mainly using openMVG and openMVS with supporting tools such as VisualSFM. We would capture images of a statue from all the angles using a drone, refine these images and create a sample set and provide it as input to the system. It would produce a sparse point cloud, which would be enhanced to get a dense point cloud, a mesh structure and then by texture mapping, would produce a 3D model. We were able to recreate a 3D model of a 50ft statue with close to 97% accuracy in terms of shape and texture. We would additionally use hole filling and in painting techniques to correct the anomalies. This project required me to apply various concepts of physics, mathematics and computer vision; and use my programming skills to work on the problem. The work and the results submitted were highly appreciated and valued by the SRIB team. Working on the project took my interest in computer vision and graphics to newer heights.\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            type: \"Internship\",\r\n            title: \"Software Engineering Intern\",\r\n            company: \"Walmart Labs\",\r\n            place: \"Bangalore\",\r\n            dates: \"Feb 2017 - Jul 2017\"\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    Iam : [\r\n        \"an artist\", \"a web developer\", \"a dumb kid\", \"an engineer\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\nexport default DataStore;","import React from 'react';\nimport DataStore from './dataStore';\nimport Typewriter from 'typewriter-effect';\n\nconst Home = () => {\n\n    const experienceDiv = () => {\n        return DataStore.experiences.map(exp => {\n            return (\n                <div className=\"single-exp\">\n                    <div className=\"title\">{exp.title}</div>\n                </div>\n            )\n        })\n    }\n\n    return (\n        <div className=\"main-container\">\n            <div id=\"myTopnav\" class=\"navigation-bar\">\n                <a href=\"#/projects\" >Projects</a>\n                <a href=\"#/contact\">Contact</a>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"banner\">\n                <div className=\"salutation\"> Hey there!
